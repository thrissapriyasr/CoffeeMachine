# Coffee Machine Simulator

## Overview

This Python script simulates a coffee machine, allowing users to place orders for espresso, latte, or cappuccino. The program tracks the resources (water, milk, coffee) and profit. Users can also request a report of the current resource levels or turn off the machine.

## Features

- **Menu Options:** Choose from a menu of espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
  
- **Resource Management:** Track the availability of water, milk, and coffee to ensure there are enough resources for each order.

- **Coin Processing:** Insert coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) to make a payment.

- **Transaction Handling:** Check if the payment is sufficient and provide change accordingly.

- **Profit Tracking:** Keep a running total of the profit earned from successful transactions.

- **Machine Status Reporting:** Request a report to see the current levels of water, milk, coffee, and the total profit.

## Usage

1. Run the script.

   ```bash
   python coffee_machine.py
   ```

2. Choose a beverage from the menu *(espresso, latte, cappuccino)* or enter "off" to turn off the machine.

3. Insert coins when prompted to pay for the selected beverage.

4. Enjoy your virtual coffee!

## Commands

- **Menu Options:** Choose "espresso," "latte," or "cappuccino" to order a beverage.

- **Report:** Type "report" to get a summary of the current resource levels and profit.

- **Turn Off:** Enter "off" to shut down the coffee machine.

## Acknowledgments
